# Cifar10 Group Project in Machine Learning

## Abstract

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, to get our Notebooks and Project Report.

```
git clone https://github.com/bohniti/cifar-10.git
```

### Prerequisites

- Of course you need git to get the source
- If you want to compile the report by yourself you need a LaTex Compiler for your OS and maybe an IDE which makes things easier
- If you want to compile, train and play with our Code you need a python working environment. We used Jupyter Notebooks. The requiered packeges you can see in the Notebooks itself.
